                    <p text-align=left; font-family=Poppins; font-style=normal; font-weight=normal; font-size=25px;>
                        <br><b> Goal: </b> Our goal for this sub-section is to learn what a major is and understand which majors are more time-efficient and less financially costly. We’ll also look into your different options and which make more sense as a pre-dental student. Finally, we’ll briefly discuss the pros and cons of choosing to take a minor.<br><br>
                        
                        One of the primary considerations when entering college is selecting a major, which determines the subject you will specialize in during your undergraduate studies to pursue a bachelor's degree. Typically spanning four years and comprising around 120 credits (approximately 40 courses), this process allows students to shape their academic trajectory and align it with their career goals.
                        
                        <br />

It is common for students to be uncertain about their desired path, leading to changes in their majors as they refine their objectives. If your intention is to pursue dentistry, you may find yourself pondering the following question: "What is the most suitable major to choose?"<br/>
In the context of dental school admissions, there are no strictly defined "right" majors, as science-based degrees are not obligatory for acceptance. Numerous students with non-science backgrounds have successfully gained admission to dental school. However, it is worth noting that certain majors can offer practical advantages and facilitate a smoother academic journey.
<br />
<br />
While any major can fulfill the requirements for dental school admission, a science major is highly recommended. Pursuing a science-oriented degree often allows for the completion of prerequisite courses while progressing toward the degree itself. In contrast, students with non-science majors must ensure they enroll in additional prerequisite courses not inherently included in their chosen degree program. This discrepancy can lead to increased time and financial investment. Thus, the efficiency and practicality of a science major become apparent.
<br />
<br />

But does having a non-science major make it harder to gain admission to dental school? In short, the answer is no. Most dental schools do not heavily weigh the specific major during the evaluation process. Instead, the focus lies on whether the applicant has successfully completed the required prerequisites. Consequently, regardless of the field in which you complete your undergraduate degree, meeting these prerequisite course requirements is of utmost importance before enrolling in dental school.

<br />
<br />

Now, let's delve into some statistics to shed further light on the relationship between majors and dental school prerequisites.

                    <br><br>
                    Having discussed the considerations surrounding major selection, let us now turn our attention to minor degrees. A minor degree can be likened to a "mini-degree" that typically involves the completion of 6-10 courses in a specific field.
                     <br><br>
                     While having a minor is not a requirement and dental schools do not extensively scrutinize it, successfully completing a minor program could potentially enhance your application and set you apart from other candidates.


                     <br><br> <h4>Is pursuing a minor degree worth it?</h4> <br> 
                     While completing a minor can modestly bolster your application, it is essential to weigh the potential impact on your grades. Undertaking a minor entails enrolling in additional courses, which may strain your schedule and potentially compromise your academic performance. In such cases, the risks associated with pursuing a minor could outweigh the benefits it might bring to your application. Consequently, prioritizing your grades and excelling in your major field of study holds greater significance than opting for a minor.
                     <br><br> 
                     By considering these factors and making informed decisions regarding your major and minor choices, you can chart a strategic academic path that optimizes your chances of gaining admission to dental school while also nurturing your personal and intellectual growth.

                <br />
                When it comes to planning your undergraduate course schedule, the task of selecting the right courses can be quite daunting. Unfortunately, college advisors often overlook two crucial factors that should be considered when enrolling in classes. Let's delve into these important considerations in more detail:<br />
                <br />

            </p>
            <h4>#1. Ensuring you meet the course requirements of dental schools.</h4>
            <br />
            It is not uncommon for advisors to guide students based solely on their degree requirements, overlooking the specific prerequisites mandated by dental schools. At DentXcel, we prioritize discussing the prerequisites of dental schools to ensure that you are aware of the courses you need to complete. To provide a comprehensive overview, we will divide the requirements of dental schools into two figures. Figure 2 will encompass courses required by all dental schools, while Figure 3 will include additional courses required by some institutions.

                    We highly recommend completing the courses that are required by a majority of dental schools, such as Biochemistry, Microbiology, Statistics, and possibly Anatomy. However, for courses that are required by only a few schools (five or fewer), we suggest considering them if they align with your top choice dental programs. These courses may include Psychology, Humanities, Calculus, Zoology, Histology, and Sociology. It is important to regularly refer to the table above and ensure that you are completing the necessary courses for the schools to which you plan to apply.

                    <br />
                    As you may already be aware, the Dental Admission Test (DAT) serves as the entrance exam to dental school. Preparing for the DAT is an essential component of the application process and requires a significant investment of time and effort. The DAT assesses your knowledge in various subjects, making it crucial to complete relevant coursework before attempting the exam to enhance your preparation.
 <br />
                    <br />
                    In the table below, you will find an overview of the subjects tested on the DAT, along with recommendations on whether these courses should be completed before the exam and their feasibility.

However, it is important to note that taking these courses before the DAT is not necessary, and you can still perform well without them. Additionally, completing these courses before the exam can be challenging, as they are typically scheduled for senior year.

                    <br><br>
                    By carefully considering these factors and making informed decisions about your course selection, you can ensure that you are on the right track to meet the prerequisites of dental schools and adequately prepare for the DAT.

                    <p text-align=left;><br><b>Goal: </b> Our goal for this sub-section is to introduce the three important types of GPAs and to look at dental schools in the US and their GPA averages. We’ll also discuss the importance of trends in dental schools. Finally, we’ll look at the effects of withdrawing or retaking courses. 
                        
                        
                        <br />
            <br />
            The academic performance of pre-dental students is a topic that often causes significant stress and self-reflection. Many students find themselves contemplating whether their grades are sufficient to secure a spot in dental school. While the application process is indeed competitive, it is important to note that dental schools take a holistic approach, and a perfect GPA is not the sole determinant of admission.<br />
            <br />
            <h4>What GPAs do dental schools consider?</h4>
            <br />
            Dental schools typically evaluate three key GPAs during the application process:
Science GPA (BCPM): This includes most biology, chemistry, physics, and math courses.
BCP GPA: This includes most biology, chemistry, and physics courses.
Cumulative GPA: This encompasses all courses taken throughout your undergraduate studies.
<br />
            <br />
            It is crucial to track and monitor these different GPAs throughout your academic journey, as they all carry significance in the eyes of dental schools. <br />
            <br />
            <h4><i>Figure 6: Average GPAs of accepted dental students:</i></h4>
            <br />
            In the table below, you will find the average science and cumulative GPAs of admitted students for each dental school in the US. Please bear in mind that these numbers are merely averages and are provided to give you a general understanding of the GPAs dental schools typically seek in applicants. It is important not to overly fixate on these figures, as each applicant is assessed holistically. <br />
            <br />
            <iframe
                style="width: -webkit-fill-available; height: 700px;"
                src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTH5-mpc9ojrPwy-TAdwTZMLKcmDxOafmEZcYTavNFkvzU5smfQ7inBAiDWUmUfH5pmElSp3e1rHWdV/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"
            ></iframe>
            <br />
            However, GPA is not the sole factor dental schools consider when evaluating applicants. They also pay attention to the trend of your GPA over the course of your undergraduate studies.
 <br />
            <br />
            <h4>GPA Trends</h4>
            <br />
            As you progress through your degree, it is common for the courses you take to become more challenging. Dental schools are aware of this and analyze the trend of your grades to discern whether they are decreasing, remaining stable, or improving over time.
 <br />
            <br />
            In many cases, students may experience a slight decline in their grades as they tackle more demanding coursework. However, it is important not to be overly concerned about the specific trend your grades follow, as it can be challenging to control. What matters is that you demonstrate perseverance and improvement in your final years. Successfully rebounding from a period of poor performance early in your undergraduate studies can have a significant positive impact on the strength of your dental school application.
 <br />
            <br />
            Let's now address the situation of failing or withdrawing from courses. When faced with failing or close-to-failing grades towards the end of the semester, you will have two options to consider.

 <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Option #1: Withdrawing from the course</h4>
            <br />
            If you believe that bringing your grade up is not a viable option, you may consider withdrawing from the course. Withdrawing will result in a "W" on your transcript, which dental schools will be able to see during the application review process. The advantage of withdrawing is that it does not affect your GPA, and schools can only speculate on the reasons for your withdrawal. However, it is important to note that the withdrawal deadline is typically early in the semester, so choosing this option removes the possibility of attempting to pass the course. <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Option #2: Remaining in the course and risk failing</h4>
            <br />
            The second option is to continue in the course and strive to improve your grades. However, if your efforts are unsuccessful and you fail the course, it will result in a grade of "D/F" on your transcript, which could significantly impact your GPA. If the failed course is a requirement for your degree and you choose to retake it, you may be offered grade forgiveness. Grade forgiveness allows you to replace your previous grade with the new one. While your school will only utilize the new grade to calculate your GPA, dental schools will consider both the old and new grades when evaluating your application.
<br />
            <br />
            <h4>So, what should I do?</h4>
            <br />
            We highly recommend monitoring the withdrawal deadline while diligently working towards improving your grades. If the calculated grades needed to pass the course appear unattainable as the withdrawal deadline approaches, withdrawing may be the better option.<br />
            <br />
            Please remember that although either option may slightly weaken your application, it will not prevent you from being accepted into dental school. Do not be discouraged and strive to limit such situations to once or twice during your undergraduate studies. Your dedication, resilience, and overall academic performance will be evaluated in a comprehensive manner by dental schools during the application process.

            <br />
            <b>Goal: </b> Our goal in this sub-section is to discuss which types of volunteering and shadowing are accepted and how many hours are required. We'll also look at how to find different opportunities.<br />
            <br />
            Volunteering and shadowing play a significant role in your application as a pre-dental student, and they are key aspects that dental schools consider when evaluating applicants. It is advisable to start volunteering and shadowing early in your undergraduate journey to gradually accumulate hours and enrich your experiences.

<br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <h4>Volunteering</h4>
        <br />
        Volunteering is one of the five experiences you can add to your application, and dental schools often assess your volunteer hours to gain insight into your interests and passions. It is important to note that volunteering does not have to be limited to dental-related activities. Instead, it is an opportunity to engage with diverse fields and communities that resonate with your personal passions.
<br />
        <br />
        <h4>How many hours should you aim for?
</h4>
        <br />
        While there is no strict requirement for volunteer hours, we highly recommend completing a minimum of 100-200 hours to be considered a serious applicant. It is beneficial to diversify your experiences by volunteering in 2-3 different places or fields.

<br />
        <br />
        <h4>Finding volunteer opportunities:</h4>
        <br />
        Discovering volunteer opportunities is generally accessible, particularly with the option to complete hours online. Below, you will find various resources to help you find volunteering opportunities, along with a template to use when contacting organizations via email. <br />

Sincerely, [Full Name]
 <br />
        <br />
       
        <h4>Shadowing</h4>
        <br />
        Shadowing is a crucial component of your preparation for dental school. It allows you to observe and familiarize yourself with the various roles and responsibilities of dentists, while also reaffirming your interest in dentistry. When shadowing, it is important to respect the dentist's space and avoid becoming a hindrance. Additionally, ask questions only when appropriate, irrespective of the topic. <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Whom should you shadow?</h4>
        <br />
        Dental schools primarily aim to train students as general dentists. Therefore, they expect applicants to possess a genuine interest in and willingness to pursue general dentistry. With this in mind, we recommend allocating most of your shadowing hours to a general dentist. However, diversifying your experiences by shadowing specialty dentists can also be beneficial. Regardless of the dental professional you choose to shadow, the focus should be on completing the required number of hours.

 <br />
        <br />
        <h4>How many hours are typically required?</h4>
        <br />
        The number of shadowing hours required can vary among dental schools, with most schools stipulating a range of 20 to 200 hours, averaging around 80 hours. While some schools may not explicitly state the number of hours required, they emphasize the importance of shadowing experience in their admissions process. Therefore, we highly recommend aiming for the highest requirement among any dental school, which is 200 hours. This will not only ensure that you meet the requirements of any dental school in the United States but also strengthen your overall application.
 <br />
        <br />
        <h4><i>Figure 7: Shadowing Hours Required by Dental Schools:</i></h4>
        <br />
        In the table below, you will find a list of all dental schools in the US and the number of shadowing hours they require. <br />
        <br />
        <iframe
            style="width: -webkit-fill-available; height: 700px;"
            src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS6EP0CNm2mWVqBEsYbenk9oWcNlmwRT5dI_u8-za2ofGQyT3xwizSRpfkippusm2KErMCpbWErMDFv/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"
        ></iframe>
        <br />
        <br />
        Finding shadowing opportunities can be challenging, particularly considering the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. As we adapt to life amidst the pandemic, there have been significant changes in how students can complete their shadowing hours. Online organizations now offer virtual shadowing experiences, which, although may not provide the same level of hands-on learning, are widely accepted by dental schools.

<br />
        <br />
        <h4>How can you find someone to shadow?</h4>
        <br />
        Virtual shadowing opportunities are easily accessible, and you can visit social media platforms to find organizations offering such experiences. You can check out Instagram accounts like "freshdentalshadowing" and "dentalshadowers" for more information.
 <br />
        <br />
        In-person shadowing can be more challenging to arrange. The most effective approach is to call different dental offices and inquire about their policy on allowing students to shadow. Alternatively, you can search for nearby dental offices online and find their contact information on their websites. The email template below can be helpful when reaching out to dental offices. <br />

        <p text-align="left;">
            <br />
            <b>Goal: </b> Our goal in this sub-section is to discuss the importance of extracurricular activities and how to get involved. We’ll also look at the significance of leadership roles. Finally, we’ll introduce work and research
            and how they can be a part of your application. <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <h4>Extracurricular Activities</h4>
        <br />
        While extracurricular activities are not mandatory for dental school applications, we believe that their inclusion can make a significant difference. Participating in extracurricular activities showcases your outgoing nature and demonstrates important qualities that dental schools value, such as leadership, teamwork, and a well-rounded personality. Moreover, involvement in extracurricular activities can be beneficial for students who may face academic challenges, as it provides an opportunity to strengthen their overall application. <br />
        <br />
        <h4>What can I get involved in?</h4>
        <br />
        One crucial extracurricular activity for pre-dental students is joining their school's pre-dental organization. Almost every university has its own pre-dental organization, and becoming actively involved is highly encouraged. If your university does not have a pre-dental organization, consider taking the initiative to establish one. Seek guidance from your advisors on how to initiate the process of registering an organization and gathering like-minded individuals who share the same aspirations.
 <br />
        <br />
        While your extracurricular activities do not necessarily have to be dental-related, we recommend exploring clubs or organizations that align with your personal interests. Joining any club or organization that captivates your curiosity can provide valuable experiences and broaden your perspective. It is particularly advantageous to seek leadership roles within these organizations, as they can significantly enhance your application. By getting involved early on, you can position yourself for potential leadership positions by the time you reach your junior year. Make an effort to leave a lasting impression on current officers and actively apply for available positions within the organizations you are engaged in.
 <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Work and Research:</h4>
        <br />
        Engaging in work and research experiences is not mandatory for dental school applications, but they can serve as strong assets in strengthening your application. While it is important to prioritize your academic performance and ensure it remains your primary focus, working students can highlight their job experiences as a testament to their ability to manage a demanding schedule and effectively balance their commitments. Dental schools value individuals who exhibit excellent time management skills, and the experience gained from employment can demonstrate your capacity to handle multiple responsibilities. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Similarly, research involvement can greatly contribute to your application's strength. If your schedule permits and you have an interest in pursuing research, consider approaching your professors or admission advisors to inquire about available research opportunities. Participating in research projects allows you to cultivate critical thinking skills, develop a deeper understanding of scientific concepts, and showcase your intellectual curiosity. It is essential to discuss your research experiences in your application, emphasizing the skills and knowledge gained through these endeavors.

<br><br>

Remember, while involvement in extracurricular activities, work, and research can enhance your application, it is equally important to strike a balance and prioritize your academic success. Consider your personal strengths, interests, and available time to determine the extent of your involvement in these areas. Ultimately, a well-rounded application reflects your dedication, passion, and commitment to becoming a successful dental professional.
