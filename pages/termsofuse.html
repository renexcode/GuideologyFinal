               Our membership gives students to access to our guides, software, mentoring and services. The membership price is bound to change over time. We are not guaranteeing the price of our membership to stay the same over time. Members who are looking to gain access for an additional time may be given a different price depending on our current prices. The same applies to extra services such as personal statement editing, supplemental editing, and mock interviews.

                  Guides:
               </h3>
               <br>
               Our guides are written and updated as often as we can. Our team work hard to ensure all information is up to date and accurate. Students are always advised to do their own research regarding each topic to ensure there are no errors in our information. Our guides are completed with the information currently available at the time they are written. We do not guarantee that all information is up to date at any time. It may take some time until new information is updated and posted on our website.

               </h3>
               <br>
               Our software is bound to change over time, as the application process changes over the years students should expect we do the same to our save your progress pages. We do our best to ensure all our progress saving pages are like that of the application pages. As all websites require maintenance students should expect that our pages could be under maintenance under any given time. Our team works hard to ensure all our pages are running smoothly. Our pages and website could experience down time and difficulties, so we advise students that it is possible our pages may not be functional at times. In the unlikely event there is a significant effect to our website that may result in the student’s information to no longer be saved, we highly advise that students copy their information or export them to another location other than our website.

                  Mentoring:
               </h3>
               <br>
               Our mentoring is available to our members. We highly recommend students either message us via the website or phone number or email us to reach a dental student or advisor. We cannot guarantee someone is always available to meet with students via zoom at any given time. We highly recommend messaging/emailing us to get the quickest response, if we are not available for live messaging, we will response via email in a timely fashion. New members can meet with a member of our team via zoom for a one-hour advising session. Afterwards students can continue to get our assistance by messaging or emailing us. Students can also meet via zoom twice more for a 30-minute follow up.
